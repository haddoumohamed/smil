The Battle of Stalingrad, fought between August 23, 1942, and February 2, 1943, was a pivotal turning point in World War II. This brutal conflict occurred in the Soviet city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and pitted the Axis forces, led by Nazi Germany, against the Soviet Union. Marked by intense urban combat and immense civilian suffering, the battle became one of the bloodiest in history, with nearly 2 million casualties. The Soviet Red Army's victory was decisive; it marked the first significant defeat of Hitler's forces on the Eastern Front. The German 6th Army, encircled and cut off by a Soviet counteroffensive, was forced to surrender, signaling the beginning of a major shift in the war's momentum. The triumph at Stalingrad boosted Soviet morale, weakened Germany's military strength, and set the stage for a series of Soviet advances that ultimately led to the fall of Berlin and the end of the war in Europe.
