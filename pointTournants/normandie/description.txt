The Débarquement en Normandie (D-Day) on June 6, 1944, was a major turning point in World War II. The Allied invasion of Normandy, also known as Operation Overlord, involved over 156,000 troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other Allied nations landing on the coast of Nazi-occupied France. This operation marked the opening of a second front in Western Europe, which forced Germany to fight a war on two fronts. The success of D-Day led to the liberation of France, including Paris, and paved the way for the Allies’ advance into Germany. It was a decisive step in weakening Nazi control over Europe and ultimately led to the defeat of Germany in 1945.
