The Second Battle of El Alamein is widely regarded as a turning point in World War II. Fought between October 23 and November 11, 1942, it marked a decisive victory for the Allied forces under General Bernard Montgomery against the Axis troops led by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. The battle halted Rommelâ€™s advance into Egypt, preventing the capture of the Suez Canal, a crucial strategic asset for the Allies. The victory forced the Axis forces to retreat from North Africa, setting the stage for the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943. This success, combined with other key events like the Battle of Stalingrad, shifted the momentum of the war in favor of the Allies, marking the beginning of the Axis's decline.
