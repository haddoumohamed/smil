The Holocaust was a period of mass genocide during World War II, orchestrated by Nazi Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Between 1941 and 1945, approximately six million Jews were murdered, along with millions of others, including Romani people, disabled individuals, Slavs, Poles, and political dissidents. The Nazis employed brutal methods such as concentration camps, extermination camps, forced labor, and gas chambers to carry out their systematic plan of extermination known as the "Final Solution." The Holocaust left a profound impact on humanity, leading to widespread efforts to promote human rights and prevent such atrocities from happening again. Memorials and educational initiatives continue to honor the victims and ensure the horrors of the Holocaust are never forgotten.
