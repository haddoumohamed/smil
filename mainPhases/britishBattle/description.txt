Through the summer and fall of 1940, the German Luftwaffe engaged the Royal Air Force in an intense aerial campaign to gain control of the skies over Britain. The Nazis sought to achieve air superiority as a prelude to a full-scale invasion of the UK. Despite being outnumbered, the skilled British pilots fought tenaciously to defend their homeland. Pilots such as "The Few" of the RAF's fighter squadrons inflicted heavy losses on the German bombers and fighters. By September, the tide had turned, with the Luftwaffe unable to achieve its objectives. The failure of the Battle of Britain marked the first major defeat of the Nazi war machine and a crucial turning point in the war. It demonstrated the resilience of the British people and the skill of the RAF, shattering Hitler's plans for invasion and setting the stage for the Allied counteroffensive.
