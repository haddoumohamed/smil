On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces launched a devastating surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The early morning raid, involving 353 aircraft launched from six aircraft carriers, caught the American forces completely off guard. In less than two hours, the attack destroyed or damaged 18 US ships, including eight battleships, and destroyed 347 aircraft. Over 2,400 Americans were killed.
The next day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress, declaring December 7 "a date which will live in infamy," and the United States formally entered World War II. This watershed moment transformed the conflict into a truly global war. America's entry brought its enormous industrial might and military resources to the Allied cause. The Japanese attack also unified the American public, ending all debate about neutrality and isolationism.
