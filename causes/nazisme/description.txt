The Nazi party, led by Adolf Hitler, rose to power in Germany in the 1930s, exploiting the country's economic and political instability following World War I. Hitler promised to restore German greatness and resentment over the Treaty of Versailles. The Nazis gained support by scapegoating minority groups, particularly Jews, and promoting aggressive German nationalism. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor and quickly consolidated control, establishing a totalitarian dictatorship. The Nazis eliminated political opposition, suppressed individual rights, and built a massive military force. This militarization, combined with Hitler's territorial ambitions, set the stage for the outbreak of World War II in Europe.
