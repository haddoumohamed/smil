On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany launched a massive invasion of Poland, marking the start of World War II in Europe. The German forces employed a new military strategy known as blitzkrieg, or "lightning war," characterized by the coordinated, rapid movement of infantry, tanks, artillery, and aircraft. German planes dominated the skies, providing air support for ground troops that swiftly advanced into Poland.
The Polish military was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer size and ferocity of the German assault. Polish forces were further hampered by a secret pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which had divided control of Poland and Eastern Europe between the two totalitarian powers.
